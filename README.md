#THE BEST HEADS

A Twitter Bot for the Top 6 headlines worldwide (ok, mostly the US now)!

It scrapes news from articles and tweets 6 of them in a single image, once in every 8 hours.

The 6 headlines belong to 6 topics each: Technology, Science, Politics, Sports, Business, Health.

I hate reading news from websites, since there are so many distractions. So, I scraped it and kept it minimal. (no images too)

I did the whole project using Python with various Libraries.

Of course, it needs more work and I have more ideas. But this is a start. Let me know if you have suggestions.

The fact that I can do a project like this excited. So I couldn't wait to share it as soon as it's done.
